# tqGamma-Modeling-with-MC-Generators
Modeling of the predicted and unobserved production of a top quark in association with a photon.
Modeling includes:
  Leading order(LO) using MadGraph5 and Pythia8
  Next-to-leading Order (NLO) using MadGraph5 and Pythia8
  NLO t+q events using Pythia8
  
LO events kinematic plots appear as a superpositon of NLO tqGamma and NLO tq plots. This leads to the conclusion that the combination of these NLO events should be sufficient in modeling the production of a top quark in associaiton with a photon.
